<p> To further enhance the abilities of our clients in conducting their own accessibility testing, we have created a simple Web Accessibility Scavenger Hunt training application. </p>
<p>The Scavenger Hunt has been designed to be as simple as possible in order to accommodate the wide range of knowledge of those that are conducting accessibility testing</p>
<p>Over the years, we have discovered that not only developers are engaged with testing the accessibility of websites and applications. The responsibility of testing also falls on various other individuals with quite a wide range of position titles; from analysts, testers, communications, information management and many other types of professionals.</p>
<p>This training exercise has been designed to accommodate those with and without technical knowledge. Scavenger Hunt participants navigate through the application using
    the "Next Page" button. Each page is designed to have a specific, obvious accessibility defect that can be linked back to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria. It is recommended that participants mark down
    each accessibility defect using the WCAG Compliance Report Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Once the Scavenger Hunt is completed, if participants wish to access the completed answers spreadsheet, participants must submit their name and email in the form at the end. </p>
<h2>The Tools</h2>
<p>The training application requires the use of a couple web accessibility testing tools, all of which are free and open-source OPS recommended tools.</p>
<p> The Scavenger Hunt requires the use of a screen reader, browser extensions and a colour contrast analyzer. </p>
<h3>Good luck with your training</h3>
